QCC:
- What is a subclass/superclass, and how do they work with each other? 

DISCO:
- Extending Protagonist and Monster from the Character class:
    - If the Character class is created but there is no body, the game ends after the user states their name.
    - If there is no Character class, the game also ends after the user states their name.

Misc:
-
