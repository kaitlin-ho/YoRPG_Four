New classes:


Summary of version to version modification:


Ways we would want to grow this game in the future:
- Add more stats! An example would be agility/speed (chance to evade an attack or chance to take less damage from one)
- More sub-roles for the adventurer; greater variety for monsters (they can have special skills too). New class with the ability to revive themselves (maybe: if the class casts the revival spell and their HP stays above 0 the next turn, they die.)
-
